Pentester-in-training | CPTS-bound  
Building scripts, projects, and dropping HTB walkthroughs

Expect to see:
🟡 Bash & Python scripts
🟡 Offensive security projects
🟡 HTB retired machine walkthroughs
🟡 My path to the CPTS certification

My first script is a simple MAC address changer a great tool for boosting privacy on public Wi-Fi when used with a VPN like Mullvad.

Spoofing your MAC helps reduce digital fingerprinting and tracking while hopping between networks.
