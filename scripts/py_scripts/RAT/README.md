Secret's Reverse Shell in Python 

Educational Python Reverse Shell (Work in Progress RAT)

This project is part of my hands-on journey toward building a fully functional Remote Access Tool in Python 

It currently operates as a basic reverse shell and will evolve to include features like:
-File exfiltration and upload 
-Directory navigation ("cd" support) 
-System enumeration
-Persistence 

<Disclaimer>
This tool is intended strictly for educational purposes,ethical hacking labs and authorized penetration testing on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
Unauthorized use is illegal and goes against the purpose of this project.

I used the loopback address and 2 different terminals to test this out.
 
Don't forget to make both files executable by using: 
sudo chmod +x  <filename> 

To execute the files use:
python3 <filename>

Open one file in one terminal and the other in another terminal and execute both 
Execute the (adv attack listener.py) first or you will get a connection refused message
